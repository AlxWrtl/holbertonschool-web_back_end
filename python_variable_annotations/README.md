# Python Exercises Collection

This repository includes a series of Python scripts demonstrating various programming concepts through practical implementations. Each script illustrates different uses of Python functionalities, ranging from simple arithmetic operations to more complex functional programming.

## Content Overview

### Mathematical Operations

- **Addition Function**
  - **Script:** `add.py`
  - **Purpose:** Adds two floating-point numbers and returns their sum.
  - **Features:** Demonstrates basic arithmetic operations and function annotations.

- **Floor Function**
  - **Script:** `floor.py`
  - **Purpose:** Returns the largest integer less than or equal to a given float, utilizing the `math.floor` function.
  - **Features:** Shows the use of the math library for mathematical operations.

- **Sum List Function**
  - **Script:** `sum_list.py`
  - **Purpose:** Calculates the sum of all floating-point numbers in a given list.
  - **Features:** Utilizes Python's built-in `sum()` function for iterating and summing elements in a list.

### String and List Manipulations

- **Concatenate Function**
  - **Script:** `concat.py`
  - **Purpose:** Returns a tuple containing two provided strings, demonstrating simple string operations.
  - **Features:** Basic data type manipulations including string concatenation and tuple creation.

- **String Conversion Function**
  - **Script:** `to_str.py`
  - **Purpose:** Converts a floating point number to its string representation.
  - **Features:** Shows basic type conversion from float to string.

### Advanced Functions and Type Hinting

- **Sum Mixed List Function**
  - **Script:** `sum_mixed_list.py`
  - **Purpose:** Sums a list containing both integers and floats and returns the total as a float.
  - **Features:** Illustrates the use of union types in type hinting for more flexible function parameters.

- **Make Multiplier Function**
  - **Script:** `make_multiplier.py`
  - **Purpose:** Returns a closure that multiplies its input by a pre-defined multiplier.
  - **Features:** Demonstrates the creation of closures and functional programming concepts.

- **Element Length Function**
  - **Script:** `element_length.py`
  - **Purpose:** Computes the length of each element in an iterable of sequences and returns a list of tuples.
  - **Features:** Utilizes list comprehensions and advanced type annotations to work with sequences and iterables.

### Variable Annotations

- **Variable Annotations Script**
  - **Script:** `variable_annotations.py`
  - **Purpose:** Illustrates how to use Python's type annotations for declaring variable types such as int, float, bool, and str.
  - **Features:** Provides examples of using type annotations for better code clarity and type checking.

Each script includes detailed comments explaining the purpose of functions and their parameters, alongside their expected input types and return types. This collection serves as a practical guide to implementing Python's capabilities in various scenarios.

## Usage

To run any of the scripts, ensure Python 3 is installed on your machine and use the following command:
```bash
python <script_name>.py
